# Most Hideous Quiz App You've Ever Seen

## Description 
A timed quiz with various trivia questions. Unfortunately I wasn't able to do everything I wanted to get it to do, but it will cycle through various questions as you select answers from a multiple choice layout. If an answer is wrong, you lose 10 seconds off the timer. when the time expires the questions disappear and you get the gameover message. One correct answer is one point and it keeps track as you go. I learned a lot from this. I will definitely need to review how to store stuff in local storage.
